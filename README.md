![Overview](morpher_vision.png)
Figure: CLIP backbone (top) and this work (bottom). If a research paper cites many papers from biology and computer science, we realize this paper will likely be about computational biology, even if we do not know what exactly computational biology is. This work leverages Multi-modal Prompt Learning for Graph Neural Networks that can effectively teach GNNs language dependency given few training samples with weak text supervision.
